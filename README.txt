The Varible Density Approximate Message Passing (VDAMP) algorithm for reconstruction 
of an image from Fourier coefficients sampled with variable density, reproducing figures from 
"Approximate Message Passing with Colored State Evolution for Variable Density Fourier Sampled Images" 
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02701] 
and the preliminary work
"An Approximate Message Passing algorithm for Rapid Parameter-Free Compressed sensing MRI" 
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01234]
by Charles Millard, Aaron T Hess, Boris Mailhe and Jared Tanner. 


demo1 runs VDAMP only, reproducing the figures that provide evidence of VDAMP's state evolution and additional figures on tracking errors. 

demo2 runs VDAMP-alpha, VDAMP-S, FISTA, S-FISTA  and SURE-IT, reproducing the remaining, comparative figures, and the results from the tables.
